## Using Cut

Cut is designed to be easily added to your projects. It can be included by adding the `-Icut/inc` to your include path, and the `src/cut.c` file to your compile list. Now, it can be included as `#include <cut/cut.h>`. Here's an example compilation command:

```sh
clang -Icut/inc src/main.c src/cut.c -o example_tests
```
